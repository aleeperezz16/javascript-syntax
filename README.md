# JavaScript Syntax 📝
## Random Message Generator ♻️

A very basic script to generate a desired number of random messages.

This script was generated to complete the assignment of the [*Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer*](https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/full-stack-engineer) course.

### Requirements
- Node.js

Open a terminal and run the following command:
```sh
node script.js [count]
```
You can set a number of messages you want the script to generate by passing a number to the `count` parameter.

By default, if no parameter is provided, the script will generate one random message.
